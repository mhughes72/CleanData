# Clean Data Final Assignment
## Thomas Matthew Hughes

I buggered this one completely.  I managed to build a function that recursed through the data directories and pulled in all the applicable data.

The result lists, however, were ingested as Factor variables and I couldn't for the life of me figure out a way to delve deeper into this data and extract the numeric values.

I tried:

* Every concieable type of "read" statement, icluding "scan", which I had a small amount of success with, but now as it applies to this assignement.

* Any type of data tranform, level-seeker and a miriad of other approaches.

I am looking forward to seeing other submissions to figure out what I missed.

There is some decent code in here (that I will re-use) but the assignement wasn't met.'
